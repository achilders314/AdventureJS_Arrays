    <h1>Welcome to AdventureJS (Array Edition)!</h1>
    <p>We're so excited to show you around the various JavaScript array methods. If you're here, 
       hopefully you have studied some basic HTML & JavaScript, and have used arrays before. This is meant
       to slowly introduce you to the world of data structures & algorithms that can show up in technical interviews.
       These are designed for beginners and increase in complexity throughout each section.
